## Mods

### Embedded Bios

Generally the core requires bios files to be located within a specific folder accessible to the core.  This modded core embedds the bios files within to core itself removing the need to co-locate the bios files in another folder.

### Button Mapping

Intellivision controller buttons have been mapped to the following ALU buttons.  Note that the "X" button toggles the virtual keypad.  Once a button on the virutual keypad has been selected, use the Y button to invoke the selected keypad button.
